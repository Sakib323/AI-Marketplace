# AI-Marketplace
Iâ€™ve been fine-tuning models like LLAMA 2, GPT, and Granite for tasks like code generation and summarization. This inspired me to create an AI marketplace where users can access my models and others from Hugging Face, build custom pipelines by combining models, and export them as executables for local use on devices like Android.
